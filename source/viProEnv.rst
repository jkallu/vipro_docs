Visual programming environment
*******************************

In the previous sections, we were showing the visual programming environment as a single block, but there are many things going on in this block. In this section we will analyse the block in details.

Visual blocks
==============

The idea of blocks for programming is coming from our nature of explaining or comprehending ideas by writing boards. This is how we explain the things to another person, our creating our ideas more clear. In this way, we will be concentrating on what to do rather than how to do.
There are many blocks available, letâ€™s go through them now.

Main block
-----------

We already saw main block in previous sections. Main block is the entry block in the program as the main function in the C. 

Array block
------------

Array block is used to generate arrays. There are different ways to generate arrays. One is the classical programming way, where we give the total number of array elements, beginning (included), upper limit (excluded) and the type as shown in Figure 3.1.

   Figure 3.1: Array definition.
   
Another way to generate the array is by the set notation (known as set comprehension or list comprehension). One can define it as,
x <- [0,1 .. 99] 

Duplicate block
---------------

This block duplicates the data into two. For example, if we have one data connection from the array block, we can duplicate the data and have two similar data outputs from duplicate block.
